Hanziroids (Hanzi = Chinese Characters meets Asteroids)

An asteroids like game built on [Chingu](https://github.com/ippa/chingu) (whose libraries and example files also here) as an exercise for the NYC Ruby Roundtable meetup


Running
=======

Go to **chingu/games** directory and run:

    $ ruby hanziroids.rb


How to Play
===========

Try to collide with matching characters. For instance match 给 with 力 to form 给力.

Actions:

    turn left:  left arrow
    turn right: right arrow
    go forward: up arrow

The game ends when you match all the characters in a set.  If you run out of lives
before this, you die!
